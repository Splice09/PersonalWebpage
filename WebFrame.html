                     <p class="summary">Greetings, my name is Patrick Fleming. I graduated from Auburn University with a degree in Software Engineering,
                     and I love the challenge of programming. In general, I attempt to practice the art of non-zero days.
                     Outlined in a response to a post on <a class="myLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af">
                     Reddit</a>; a non-zero day is performing any action during the day that
                     moves me closer to my dreams. Examples include: writing at least one line of code, practicing music theory,
                     reading a book, even exercising. As long as a minimum of one thing gets accomplished, it's a non-zero day.
                     If you're interested in speaking; contact me. Let's get something done today!</p>

                <div class="contentHeader">Current Work</div>
                <div class="cwContent"><p class = "date">September 2015</p>
                    <p class = "newLine">This is my first current work status update. For the past two months I have been working to put together this resume website. There were two reasons that have headed its creation. First and foremost, is to learn and better understand web development. Second, is to have a practical resume that feels more alive. It's been an enlightening experience so far, and I hope to learn much more as development continues.</p>
                    <p class = "newLine">Site Specs:</p>
                    <p class = "tabLine">I built the server back-end with Node.js using Connect middleware.</p>
                    <p class ="twoTabLine">-	This was a challenge because there was not much visual feedback for my work, but probably the most educational as far as web development is concerned.</p>
                    <p class ="tabLine">The client side front-end is constructed with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
                    <p class = "twoTabLine">-	I tried to be true to form and develop completely from scratch, which is why I avoided boot strap. I wanted to experience the site design first hand, as well as make my own image.</p>
                    <p class = "twoTabLine">-	In light of progress, I currently am using JQuery. I am entertaining the idea of eventually updating this to raw JavaScript. Only to maintain the personal goal of a homemade website.</p>
                    <p class = "tabLine">For scalability and easy updates, I am using Heroku PostgreSQL for the Past Projects page and soon to be Current Work page.</p>
                    <p class = "twoTabLine">-	I wanted some experience with databases, and I felt that this would be the best way to continuously update the page without editing the HTML.</p>
                    <p class = "newLine">Future Plans:</p>
                    <p class = "tabLine">-	Finish the Contact section to include links to e-mail, and other important social media - this will house a link to my Git repository (which holds website code).</p>
                    <p class = "tabLine">-	Edit the styles of my responsive design versions so that mobile display works properly with all of the newly added content.</p>
                    <p class = "tabLine">-	Set up cashe for queries - I am unsatisfied with their impact on page load time.</p>
                    <p class = "tabLine">-	Final adjustments to styles.</p>
                    <p class = "toast">Thanks for stopping by!</p>
